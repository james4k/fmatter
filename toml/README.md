# fmatter

A TOML Front Matter parser, using BurntSushi's toml package. View the godoc documentation [here](http://godoc.org/github.com/james4k/fmatter/toml). The TOML package used is pure Go, unlike the goyaml package used in the original [fmatter](http://github.com/james4k/fmatter) package. TOML seems to be a good alternate format for front matter, too.

## Installation

	go get github.com/james4k/fmatter/toml
